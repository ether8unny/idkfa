Data Source (free data set):
http://www.ngrams.info/using.asp


Data Explanation:
Entries with proper names and/or non-standard words are removed. 
Entries are converted to runes then expressed in Latin characters to facilitate human readability.
(It should be easy to write a converter back to runes).
Only N-grams that are present in the Liber-Primus 'remaining 56 pages' have been included. 
The numbers in the filename give the number of runes for each word.


Comments:
This data was produced over a year ago, it's about time we shared things more :). 
I have found it useful for giving ideas for cribs for certain sections. 
There are many N-grams in the Liber Primus that are not in this set (see the empty files).
This mainly happens with long rune words - indicating they are not common words (e.g. circumferences?). 
This is a common problem, language is complex, see, for example:

Further Studies:
Vast numbers of N-grams are available from Google:

Due to the resources (bandwidth, disc space and processing time) required, balanced against 
the likely gains this data set has not been used yet.
